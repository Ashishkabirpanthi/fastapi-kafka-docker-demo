   Go to the releases page and select the latest version. Click the link to download the necessary files.

2. **Extract the Files:**
   If your download is in a zipped format, extract the files to a folder of your choice.

3. **Open a Terminal:**
   Launch your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.

4. **Build and Run the Docker Containers:**
   Execute the following command to start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This command pulls the required images and starts the Kafka and FastAPI services.

5. **Access the Application:**
   Once the services are running, open your web browser and type:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   You will see the FastAPI interface, where you can begin interacting with the demo.

## 📊 How It Works

- **Kafka:** Acts as a message broker. It handles the exchange of messages between different services.
- **FastAPI:** Provides a web interface for users. It allows users to send and receive messages easily.
- **Docker:** Simplifies the setup process. It ensures that all dependencies run smoothly in isolated environments.

## 📦 Usage

When you first access the FastAPI web interface, you will see options to send and receive messages. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Send a Message:**
   - Navigate to the endpoint for sending messages.
   - Input your message and hit send.
   - Your message will be processed and passed through Kafka.

2. **Receive Messages:**
   - Go to the endpoint for receiving messages.
   - View messages as they arrive in real time.
